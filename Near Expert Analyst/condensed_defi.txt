Schema: defi

Standard Columns (present in all tables unless otherwise noted):
- block_id: Height of the chain this block corresponds with
- block_timestamp: UTC timestamp of the block, primary index column for time-based queries
- tx_hash: Unique identifier for each transaction

Table: ez_bridge_activity
Purpose: Tracks cross-chain bridge transactions on NEAR.
Key Columns:
- token_address: Contract address of the token being bridged
- symbol: Shorthand symbol for the token
- amount: Amount of tokens transferred (decimal adjusted)
- amount_usd: USD value of bridged tokens
- destination_address: Address tokens are being sent to
- source_address: Originating address from which tokens are being sent
- platform: Protocol utilized for the bridging operation
- bridge_address: Address of the bridge contract
- destination_chain: Recipient blockchain in the bridge transaction
- source_chain: Originating blockchain in the bridge transaction
- direction: Direction of funds through the bridge (inbound/outbound)
- receipt_succeeded: Boolean indicating if the bridge transaction was successful

Table: ez_dex_swaps
Purpose: Records token swap events on decentralized exchanges.
Key Columns:
- platform: DEX platform used (e.g., "v2.ref-finance.near")
- pool_id: Unique identifier for the liquidity pool
- trader: Address of the account initiating the swap
- token_in_contract: Contract address of the token being sold
- symbol_in: Symbol of the token being sold
- amount_in: Amount of tokens being sold (decimal adjusted)
- amount_in_usd: USD value of tokens being sold
- token_out_contract: Contract address of the token being bought
- symbol_out: Symbol of the token being bought
- amount_out: Amount of tokens being bought (decimal adjusted)
- amount_out_usd: USD value of tokens being bought
- swap_input_data: JSON object with swap input parameters

Table: ez_lending
Purpose: Tracks lending and borrowing activities on NEAR DeFi protocols.
Key Columns:
- platform: Lending protocol used (e.g., "burrow")
- sender_id: Wallet address of the user initiating the action
- actions: Type of lending action (deposit, withdraw, borrow, repay, etc.)
- contract_address: Address of the lending protocol's smart contract
- token_address: Contract address of the token involved
- symbol: Symbol of the token involved
- amount: Decimal-adjusted amount of tokens involved in the action
- amount_usd: USD value of the tokens involved
- price_usd: USD price of the token at the time of the action

Common Usage Patterns:
1. Use block_timestamp for time-based analysis and filtering of DeFi activities.
2. Analyze ez_bridge_activity to track cross-chain token movements and bridge usage.
3. Use ez_dex_swaps to measure trading volume, popular trading pairs, and DEX usage.
4. Examine ez_lending to understand lending and borrowing trends across different platforms.
5. Join these tables with core.ez_token_transfers for a comprehensive view of token movements in DeFi activities.
6. Aggregate data by platform, token, or time periods to identify trends in NEAR's DeFi ecosystem.
