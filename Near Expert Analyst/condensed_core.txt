Schema: core

Standard Columns (present in most tables unless otherwise noted):
- block_id: Height of the chain this block corresponds with
- block_timestamp: UTC timestamp of the block, primary index column for time-based queries
- tx_hash: Unique identifier for each transaction

Table: dim_address_labels
Purpose: Provides labels and metadata for NEAR addresses.
Key Columns:
- address: The NEAR address associated with the label
- address_name: Name attributed to the address
- project_name: Associated project name, if applicable
- label_type: High-level category describing the address's main function
- label_subtype: Sub-category providing further detail

Table: ez_token_transfers
Purpose: Tracks token transfer events on the NEAR blockchain.
Key Columns:
- contract_address: Address of the deployed token contract
- from_address: Sender of the token
- to_address: Receiver of the token
- amount: Decimal adjusted amount of tokens transferred
- amount_usd: USD value of the transferred tokens
- symbol: Token symbol
- transfer_type: Nature of the transfer (e.g., 'native' for NEAR, 'nep141' for NEAR tokens)

Table: fact_actions_events
Purpose: Records detailed information about actions and events within transactions.
Key Columns:
- action_id: Unique identifier for each action
- predecessor_id: Account that was the immediate caller to the smart contract
- receiver_id: NEAR account on which the receipt was executed
- signer_id: Account that originally signed the transaction
- action_name: Name of the action performed
- action_data: JSON object containing argument data for the action
- receipt_succeeded: Boolean indicating whether the receipt was successfully processed

Table: fact_blocks
Purpose: Provides detailed information about each block.
Key Columns:
- block_hash: Unique identifier of the block
- tx_count: Number of transactions in the block
- block_author: Validator who authored the block
- gas_price: Gas price for transactions in this block
- total_supply: Total supply of NEAR tokens at this block
- validator_reward: Reward given to the validator for this block

Table: fact_logs
Purpose: Records logs associated with transactions.
Key Columns:
- receipt_object_id: Unique identifier of the receipt object for the transaction
- predecessor_id: Account that was the immediate caller to the smart contract
- receiver_id: NEAR account on which the receipt was executed
- clean_log: JSON string containing the logs linked to the transaction
- gas_burnt: Amount of gas used in the transaction

Table: fact_receipts
Purpose: Tracks receipts generated from transactions.
Key Columns:
- receipt_object_id: Unique identifier of the receipt object
- receiver_id: NEAR account on which the receipt was executed
- predecessor_id: Account that initiated the action
- transfer_amount: Amount transferred (if applicable)
- gas_burnt: Amount of gas used
- success_value: Indicates if the transaction was successful
- logs: Array of logs generated during execution

Table: fact_transactions
Purpose: Provides detailed information about each transaction.
Key Columns:
- nonce: Nonce for transactions
- tx_receiver: The transaction receiver
- tx_signer: The transaction signer
- actions: Array of actions performed in the transaction
- gas_used: Units of gas required to execute this transaction
- transaction_fee_near: Total fee paid in NEAR to execute this transaction
- tx_succeeded: Indicates whether the transaction failed or succeeded

Common Usage Patterns:
1. Use block_timestamp for time-based analysis and filtering.
2. Join fact_transactions with fact_receipts and fact_logs for comprehensive transaction analysis.
3. Use ez_token_transfers for token movement analysis, including native NEAR transfers.
4. Combine dim_address_labels with other tables for richer context on address activities.
5. Analyze fact_blocks for network health and validator performance metrics.
