Common Usage Patterns:
1. Join mint_address with dim_nft_metadata for collection context
2. Track primary sales through fact_nft_mints
3. Analyze secondary market through fact_nft_sales
4. Monitor payment_mint to distinguish between SOL and SPL token sales
5. Join mint_address with dim_nft_metadata for collection details
6. Track primary market through fact_nft_mint_actions
7. Monitor NFT burns through fact_nft_burn_actions
8. Analyze secondary market through fact_nft_sales
9. Use fact_nft_mint_actions to identify NFT creators/projects

Note: Solana NFTs use the SPL Token standard with metadata programs, different from EVM's ERC-721/1155.
