Schema: price

Table: dim_asset_metadata
Purpose: Provides metadata for tokens across the Solana ecosystem.
Key Columns:
- token_address: Token mint address
- symbol: Trading symbol
- name: Token name
- decimals: Number of decimal places
- is_native: Boolean flag for SOL vs SPL tokens

Table: ez_prices_hourly
Purpose: Provides hourly price data for tokens.
Key Columns:
- hour: Hour timestamp for price point
- token_address: Token mint address
- price: USD price at end of hour
- decimals: Token decimal places
- is_native: True for SOL, false for SPL tokens
- is_imputed: If price was estimated/carried forward

Common Usage Patterns:
1. Join with token_address and hour for USD conversions
2. Use is_imputed to filter for actual vs estimated prices
3. Reference decimals for proper amount adjustments
4. Filter is_native for SOL-specific analysis

Note: Unlike EVM chains, Solana uses mint addresses instead of contract addresses for tokens.
