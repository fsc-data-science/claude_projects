Common Usage Patterns:
1. Track validator performance through fact_block_production and fact_votes_agg_block
2. Monitor rewards across different types using fact_rewards_* tables
3. Analyze governance participation through proposal and voting tables
4. Track gauge voting and liquidity incentives
5. Monitor validator commission changes and stake distribution
6. Use dim_epoch for time-based aggregations
7. Track validator performance across epochs
8. Analyze stake concentration and delegation patterns
9. Monitor stake activation/deactivation cycles
