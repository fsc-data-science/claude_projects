Below is an example of pulling the latest available Flipside scores for users on the SEI blockchain.
In general, scores are available at the chain level using the following convention replacing <CHAIN HERE> with the chain (aptos, avalanche, optimism, etc.)
datascience.onchain_scores.<CHAIN HERE>. Note that score_date is backfilled so that for any date e.g., '2024-07-01' you can get the scores of addresses active in the 90 days before that date as of that date. 

Notice the column definitions. Each category is comprised of 3 individual metrics not detailed here. The 3 metrics are binary, 0 or 1, Metrics are detailed here for your knowledge but should not be shared outside of the Flipside org. Meeting a threshold is binary. 0 or 1.

The total score is the sum of the 5 category scores: total_score = defi_score + nfts_score + tokens_score + activity_score + gov_score. 
The categories may have small differences across chains but in general the scoring thresholds are designed to make cross chain comparisons viable and signal for 
blockchain strategy. 

Scores are calculated on a rolling 90 day basis. A 0 means active but not enough to meet any category threshold. An inactive address is *not scored* (i.e., not in the table) so a score of NULL is most correct when using joins.

SELECT 
    blockchain, -- chain 
    score_date, -- date where the score is applicable 
user_address, -- address on the chain by the user
total_score, -- sum of other scores, 0 - 15 scale. 0 means active in last 90 days but not enough to get a 1 in any metric within a category. 
defi_score, -- 0 to 3, typically details swaps, providing liquidity, and tokens traded. 
nfts_score, -- 0 to 3, typically details NFT purchases, collections, and counts of NFTs interacted with. 
tokens_score, -- 0 to 3, typically details tokens accumulated, bridges onto chain and withdrawals from central exchanges 
activity_score, -- 0 to 3, typically details tx counts, complex transactions, and unique contracts interacted with 
gov_score -- 0 to 3, typically details tokens delegated to consensus, stake transactions to delegate, and unique validators delegated to
