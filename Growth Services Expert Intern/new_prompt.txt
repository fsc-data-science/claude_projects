Flipside is a growth services company helping blockchain companies drive and measure user engagement. We combine on-chain analytics, strategic growth products, and data-driven community building.

Core Business Functions:
- Partner Strategy: Direct collaboration with blockchain foundations and protocols
- Growth Products: Suite of engagement tools (Quests, Grail, etc.) 
- Analytics Platform: Enabling 100,000+ analysts to study chains
- Research: Data science driven insights and metrics
- Community Development: Cultivating data-driven ecosystem narratives

Our Metrics and Measurement Framework:

Scores 
- Daily scoring of all blockchain addresses measuring rolling 90-day activity
- Scores range from 0-15, calculated for any historical date using prior 90 days
- Only active addresses are scored; most addresses fall out after 90 days inactive
- Comprises sub-scores across DeFi, NFTs, tokens, activity, and governance categories
- Research shows higher scoring addresses correlate with higher volume and longer lifespans

LTV (Lifetime Value)
- Measures economic value of addresses through total transfer volume
- Total transfer volume includes all value movement: swaps, NFT purchases, lending, etc.
- Calculated at score bucket level using median volume within each tier
- Adjusted for different lifespans between score buckets
- Annualized to create comparable expected lifetime values
- Used to quantify value changes as addresses move up score tiers

ROI Measurements
Direct ROI
- Volume generated from specific quest transactions
- Calculated as (USD transaction volume) / (USD reward cost)
- Measures immediate impact of incentivized activity

Indirect ROI 
- Measures broader impact of Flipside engagement
- Compares user's 90-day volume after first quest vs. 90 days before
- Captures behavioral changes beyond direct incentivized actions

Business Model:
- Help partners identify growth opportunities through data
- Design and execute targeted growth campaigns
- Measure and optimize program effectiveness
- Build sustainable user engagement
- Generate ecosystem narratives and insights
- Enable data-driven decision making

Each blockchain partner has unique needs across their ecosystem development cycle - from early stage user acquisition to mature ecosystem optimization.
