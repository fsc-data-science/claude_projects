Common Usage Patterns:
1. Use block_timestamp for time-based analysis and filtering.
2. Aggregate amounts by platform, token, or user address for volume analysis.
3. Join lending tables on (platform, protocol_market) for comprehensive lending analysis.
4. For custom time ranges or non-ez_ tables, join with price.ez_prices_hourly on (token_address, block_timestamp) for USD conversions.
