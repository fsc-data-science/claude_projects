Certainly! Here's a condensed overview of the PRICE schema:

```
Schema: price

Note: This schema provides token price data and metadata across various blockchains.

Table: dim_asset_metadata
Purpose: Provides basic metadata for assets across different blockchains and data providers.
Key Columns:
- blockchain: The blockchain network where the token exists (e.g., "ethereum", "base")
- blockchain_id: Unique identifier for the blockchain, used in cross-chain contexts
- token_address: The contract address of the token on the blockchain
- provider: The data provider supplying the price information (e.g., "coingecko", "coinmarketcap")
- asset_id: Identifier used by the provider for this asset
- symbol: The trading symbol of the token (e.g., "ETH", "USDC")
- name: The full name of the token (e.g., "Ethereum", "USD Coin")

Table: ez_asset_metadata
Purpose: Provides consolidated and enriched asset metadata.
Key Columns:
- blockchain: The blockchain network where the token exists
- token_address: The contract address of the token (null for native assets)
- asset_id: Unique identifier for the asset across providers and blockchains
- symbol: The trading symbol of the token
- name: The full name of the token
- decimals: The number of decimal places used to represent the token's smallest unit
- is_native: Boolean flag indicating if the asset is the native token of the blockchain
- is_deprecated: Boolean flag indicating if the token is no longer actively traded or maintained

Table: ez_prices_hourly
Purpose: Provides hourly price data for assets.
Key Columns:
- blockchain: The blockchain network where the token exists
- hour: The hour for which the closing price was selected
- token_address: The contract address of the token (null for native assets)
- symbol: The trading symbol of the token
- name: The full name of the token
- decimals: The number of decimal places for the token
- price: The price of the token in USD terms, adjusted for decimals
- is_native: Boolean flag for native blockchain assets
- is_imputed: Boolean flag indicating if the price was carried forward or imputed
- is_deprecated: Boolean flag for deprecated tokens

Table: fact_prices_ohlc_hourly
Purpose: Provides detailed hourly price data including open, high, low, and close prices.
Key Columns:
- hour: The hour for which this candle data is relevant
- provider: The data provider supplying the price information
- asset_id: Identifier used by the provider for this asset
- open: The opening price for the asset during this hour
- low: The lowest price for the asset during this hour
- high: The highest price for the asset during this hour
- close: The closing price for the asset at the end of this hour

Common Usage Patterns:
1. Use ez_prices_hourly for most price-related queries, as it provides consolidated and easy-to-use price data.
2. Join ez_prices_hourly with tables from other schemas on (token_address, hour) to add price information to transaction or event data.
3. Use ez_asset_metadata to get additional information about tokens, especially when working across multiple blockchains.
4. When more detailed price information is needed (e.g., intra-hour price movements), use fact_prices_ohlc_hourly.
5. For provider-specific queries or when needing to distinguish between different price sources, use dim_asset_metadata in conjunction with fact_prices_ohlc_hourly.
6. When working with native blockchain assets (e.g., ETH on Ethereum), use the is_native flag in ez_prices_hourly and ez_asset_metadata.
7. Be aware of the is_imputed and is_deprecated flags in ez_prices_hourly when analyzing price data, especially for less liquid or older tokens.
8. For historical analysis, combine ez_prices_hourly with tables from other schemas to calculate USD values for past transactions or holdings.

This condensed version provides an overview of the key tables in the PRICE schema, highlighting their purposes, key columns, and common usage patterns. It emphasizes the ez_ tables while also noting the usefulness of the fact_ and dim_ tables for specific scenarios.
