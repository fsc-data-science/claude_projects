Schema: core

Standard Columns (present in most tables unless otherwise noted):
- block_id: Block height of the chain
- block_timestamp: UTC timestamp of the block, primary index column for time-based queries
- tx_id: Unique identifier for each transaction
- tx_succeeded: Boolean indicating if the transaction was successful

Note: Sei has several unique features including address mapping between Sei and Sei EVM addresses, and a native oracle system for price feeds.

Table: dim_address_mapping
Purpose: Maps addresses between Sei's native and EVM chains.
Key Columns:
- sei_address: The native Sei blockchain address
- evm_address: Corresponding address on Sei's EVM chain
- block_timestamp_associated: When the mapping was created
Note: Unique to Sei, enables cross-chain address resolution.

Table: dim_labels
Purpose: Provides labels and metadata for Sei addresses.
Key Columns:
- address: The Sei address associated with the label
- address_name: Name attributed to the address
- label_type: High-level category (e.g., dex, operator)
- label_subtype: Sub-category providing further detail
- project_name: Associated project name, if applicable

Table: fact_oracle_votes
Purpose: Records validator price feed votes for Sei's native oracle.
Key Columns:
- voter: Validator address submitting the price vote
- tx_sender: Address initiating the oracle vote
- amount: Price value being voted on
- currency: Asset being priced
Note: Sei-specific table supporting native price oracle functionality.

Table: fact_transactions
Purpose: Records detailed transaction information.
Key Columns:
- tx_from: Address initiating the transaction
- codespace: Namespace for error handling
- fee: Transaction fee in usei
- gas_used: Computation units consumed
- msgs: Array of messages in transaction
Note: Includes oracle vote transactions unique to Sei.

Table: fact_transfers
Purpose: Tracks token transfers on Sei.
Key Columns:
- transfer_type: Type of transfer (e.g., 'SEI')
- sender: Address sending tokens
- receiver: Address receiving tokens
- amount: Transfer amount
- currency: Token being transferred (usually 'usei')

Common Usage Patterns:
1. Join dim_address_mapping with other tables to correlate native and EVM activities
2. Use fact_oracle_votes to analyze validator price submissions
3. Combine fact_transactions with oracle_votes for comprehensive price feed analysis
4. Use block_timestamp for time-based filtering and analysis
