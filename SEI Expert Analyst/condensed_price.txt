Schema: price

Note: Sei features a native oracle system where validators submit price feeds. This schema complements that system with historical price data.

Table: ez_prices_hourly
Purpose: Provides hourly price data for assets.
Key Columns:
- hour: Timestamp for the price data
- token_address: Contract address of the token
- symbol: Token symbol
- name: Token name
- price: USD price of the token
- blockchain: Chain identifier
- is_native: Flag for native token (sei)
- is_imputed: Flag for imputed prices
- is_deprecated: Flag for deprecated tokens
Note: Can be joined with oracle votes for price feed analysis

Table: dim_asset_metadata
Purpose: Provides token metadata across chains.
Key Columns:
- token_address: Contract address of the token
- asset_id: Unique identifier for the asset
- symbol: Token symbol
- name: Token name
- blockchain: Chain identifier
- provider: Source of price data

Common Usage Patterns:
1. Join ez_prices_hourly with core.fact_oracle_votes for comprehensive price analysis
2. Use hourly prices for historical analysis and USD conversions
3. Reference dim_asset_metadata for token details
4. Track native sei token pricing
5. Monitor IBC token prices on Sei

Note: Consider both oracle and traditional price feeds when analyzing Sei assets
