Schema: defi

Standard Columns (present in all tables unless otherwise noted):
- block_number: Height of the chain, increases with each new block
- block_timestamp: UTC timestamp of the block, primary index for time-based queries
- version: Unique identifier for each transaction, increments by 1 (Aptos-specific)
- tx_hash: Unique identifier for each transaction

Note: APT (native token) has 8 decimal places (1e8). Non-decimal adjusted amounts should be divided by 1e8 for the actual value. Or, more ideally, use the already adjusted columns if available.

Table: ez_dex_swaps
Purpose: Records token swap events on decentralized exchanges.
Key Columns:
- event_index: Order of the event within the transaction
- platform: Name of the DEX platform
- event_address: Address of the contract where the swap event occurred
- swapper: Address that initiated the swap
- token_in, token_out: Full addresses of the swapped tokens (account::module::resource)
- symbol_in, symbol_out: Symbols of the swapped tokens
- amount_in_unadj, amount_out_unadj: Non-decimal adjusted swap amounts
- amount_in, amount_out: Decimal-adjusted swap amounts
- amount_in_usd, amount_out_usd: USD values of swapped amounts

Table: fact_bridge_activity
Purpose: Tracks cross-chain bridge transactions on Aptos.
Key Columns:
- platform: Name of the bridging platform
- bridge_address: Address of the bridge contract
- event_name: Name of the bridge event
- direction: "inbound" or "outbound"
- tx_sender: Address initiating the transaction
- sender, receiver: Addresses involved in the bridge transfer
- source_chain_id, destination_chain_id: Numeric identifiers of the chains involved
- source_chain_name, destination_chain_name: Names of the chains involved
- token_address: Address of the token being bridged
- amount_unadj: Non-decimal adjusted amount of tokens bridged
