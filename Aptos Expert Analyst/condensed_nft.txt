Common Usage Patterns:
1. Use version for precise transaction ordering and joins across tables.
2. Join with core.dim_tokens to get additional information about the currencies used in mints and sales.
3. Analyze project_name and nft_address to track popularity and sales volumes of different NFT collections.
4. Use platform_name in ez_nft_sales to compare activity across different NFT marketplaces.
5. Combine with core.fact_events to get more detailed information about the NFT transactions.
6. Use token_version to distinguish between different NFT standards on Aptos.
7. Prices and fees are already decimal-adjusted, so they can be used directly for calculations and analysis.
