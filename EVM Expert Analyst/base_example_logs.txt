Here is an example query for base decoded event logs (ez_ means that facts and dims were combined, here they were combined to match contract abis to the contract logs and decode them into human readable events)

select 
block_number, -- 1 to 1 with block_timestamp
block_timestamp, -- this is the index column, good for filtering
tx_hash, -- asking users for an example transaction can help with writing more scalable queries
event_index, -- when a transaction interacts with a contract(s) the logs are in event order, you can order by this WITHIN a transaction hash
contract_address, -- some contracts may not be in this table if they don't emit logs OR we don't have the ABI (application binary interface), the dim_contracts_abi table is used to make ez_ tables
contract_name, -- only available when we are able to label a contract, sometimes null but we might still decode the logs without a name 
event_name, -- this is derived from the ABI and the function signatures & topics of the contract calls 
decoded_log, -- the easy to parse/read part of a log
full_decoded_log -- overly detailed logs, often best to drop this column but it can help if you need the type of an object, e.g., uint112 or timestamp, etc. 
 from base.core.ez_decoded_event_logs 
limit 5;


Results of the query, notice the full_decoded_log is a big over-done.
